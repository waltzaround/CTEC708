# CTEC708 VR Music Controller

VR music controller that requires an Oculus DK2 headset and a Leap Motion sensor to function.

We have a [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lQ19QmZj/matter) available for viewing upcoming 
features and checking the progress of bug fixes.

##Setup Instructions

Make sure you are running Unity `5.3.4` as this is the most compatible version with this project to date.
 

##Instructions

- Refer to the `Dynamic Visualizer` folder for the current build with Leap Motion integration and audio analysis
- Refer to the `Kinect Test` folder for an abandoned attempt to build it with the Kinect 2 SDK
- Refer to the `UnityOSCTest` folder for the repo we tried to use to sync with LiveOSC 

##Assignment Compliance (Lecturers, look here please)

Hello Lecturers! This section will be relevant to you :)

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive VR interface with the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion.
We seek to explore new applications of VR technology and the potential to extend the boundaries of human-computer interaction or HCI. Exploration will be conducted with a specific focus on audio production, using VR interfaces.

###Timeline:

####Week 1
The first week was spent onboarding team members onto the toolchain (Github, SourceTree, Unity, Trello) and build processes that were essential to collaborating together on a software project. Development began slowly as ideas were drafted and conceptualized as low-fidelity models on paper.  

[Team formation](https://github.com/waltzaround/CTEC708-VR-Controller/commit/87b89f97577776e13be141a01cbd0e7725c7ba1b)

####Week 2

We began developing the project around the Kinect 2 SDK, and succeeded in building an early prototype that demonstrated a virtual keyboard. However, working with the SDK proved to be difficult as the data quality the sensor provided was dismally subpar. Thumbs would disappear and reappear momentarily even though the sensor had direct line of sight to user's body parts.

Initial scoping with the kinect 


@todo sections for assessment
- initial scoping for kinect & data quality issues
- implementing plugins and how relying on external plugins is a dangerous move ie: you base an entire project on a plugin you find that doesn't end up working because there is no real way to debug or test or even check that the code is running :(
- how that failed
- shift to leap
- project management
- adopting toolchains
- awesome stuff
