# CTEC708 VR MIDI Controller

Hello Lecturers! This section will be relevant to you :)

The purpose of this project is to create a VR interface with the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion.
We seek to explore new applications of VR technology and the potential to extend the boundaries of human-computer interaction or HCI. Exploration will be conducted with a specific focus on audio production, using VR interfaces.

@todo sections for assessment
- initial scoping for kinect & data quality issues
- how that failed
- shift to leap
- project management
- adopting toolchains
- awesome stuff
